### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

A sample database has been created for the purpose of this project and the data is loaded into the created tables using SQL Server. The following files can be run after creating a database called "BikeStores":
- BikeStores - Create Objects
- BikeStores - Load Data
- BikeStores - SQL Join

A JOIN operation has been performed to obtain only the data needed for gaining insights on sales performance. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The sales data has been uploaded into Excel from SQL Server and the following analysis were performed:
1. The year generated the highest revenue
2. The brand of cycles that were the top sellers
3. The category of bikes that were most sort after based on store location
4. The employees who generated the most sales based on region
5. The top customers based on region
6. The number of customers in each region

### Results

2. "Trek" brand of cycles were the top sellers
3. Mountain Bikes were the highest sold product overall
